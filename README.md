Backend System Development

## Database Schema Generation (Postrgesql)

Before starting development, we need to create a database schema. We can take help of tools like [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home) to create a database schema.

This is a simple database schema for a blog application. We have 2 tables, `users` and `posts`. A user can have multiple posts, but a post can only have one user. This is a one-to-many relationship.

Users can follow other users. This is a many-to-many relationship. We need a third table to store this relationship. We call this table `follows`. This table has two columns, `following_user_id` and `following_user_id`. Both of these columns are foreign keys to the `users` table.
